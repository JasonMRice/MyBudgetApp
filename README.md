# MyBudgetApp

This web application is for helping people to develop a budget. People can log in and see a budget based on their personal expenses and income. Currently this is not functional, but this is the plan. I will continue to build and add functionality as time permits.

I want to show people a way of budgetting for the future, so they don't have to live pay check to pay check.
